# Object orientation

## The files in this repo

* [`the-journey.md`](the-journey.md): A walk-through of how we can go from simple object literals to prototypal inheritance. This is a text version of the [video lecture](https://youtu.be/-CDg8FXdfko).
* [`index.js`](index.js): This is the code we created in the lecture on ES5 object orientation (above).
* [`call-apply-bind.js`](call-apply-bind.js): The code we created in the discussion of `call`, `apply` and `bind`. [The video of the lecture](https://youtu.be/euxQV2SNBLI).
* [`classes.js`](classes.js): The code we created in the discussion of ES6 object orientation. The screencast of this lecture is at the end of the call, apply and bind lecture, but you can [jump directly to it here](https://youtu.be/euxQV2SNBLI?t=37m27s).
* [`call-apply-bind.first.js`](call-apply-bind.first.js) and [`classes.first.js`](classes.first.js) are files created in a previous lecture for a different cohort. They've been includes as just additional examples, but may have limited value.
